# Git and GitHub Lab

## Overview
This lab provides hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, focusing on essential version control practices such as creating a repository, making commits, handling merge conflicts, and working with branches. Through a series of exercises, students will learn how to collaborate effectively using GitHub and resolve common issues encountered in team-based development.

## Objectives
- Understand how to create and manage a repository in GitHub.
- Learn how to make commits and push changes to a remote repository.
- Implement and test functions in Python while tracking changes using Git.
- Work collaboratively by introducing and resolving merge conflicts.
- Gain experience with branching, pull requests, and code reviews.
- Learn how to revert commits and manage advanced conflicts.

## Lab Activities
1. **Creating a README File** – Add project documentation using Markdown.
2. **Adding and Testing a Function** – Implement a simple function, write unit tests, and commit changes.
3. **Introducing an Error** – Simulate a coding mistake to understand test failures and debugging.
4. **Resolving Merge Conflicts** – Handle conflicts that arise from concurrent edits.
5. **Creating and Merging Branches** – Work on new features separately before integrating them.
6. **Managing Advanced Conflicts** – Resolve file deletions and modifications in a collaborative setting.
7. **Reverting Commits** – Undo changes while preserving repository history.

## Purpose
This lab is designed to build foundational skills in version control, emphasizing best practices for collaborative software development. By completing these exercises, students will become proficient in using GitHub for team projects, ensuring efficient code management and version tracking.
